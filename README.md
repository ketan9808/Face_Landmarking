# Face_Landmarking

The repository contain code demonstrating use of face landmarking model. For the use of this model I have used dlib for finding landmarks and opencv for camera related operations. This face landmarking model returns 5 points on face ie. left and right corner of both eye and tip of nose.

screenshot, explanation of model, creating model from scratch .... to be uploaded.
